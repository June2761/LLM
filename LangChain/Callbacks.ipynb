      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups cooked short-grain rice\n",
      "- 1 carrot, julienned\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, julienned\n",
      "- 1 cup bean sprouts\n",
      "- 1 cup spinach\n",
      "- 4 shiitake mushrooms, sliced\n",
      "- 1/2 pound beef (you can use sirloin or ribeye), thinly sliced\n",
      "- 4 eggs\n",
      "- 4 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- Salt, to taste\n",

      "1. Cook the rice according to the package instructions and set aside.\n",
      "2. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt. Marinate the beef in this mixture for about 10 minutes.\n",

      "6. In a separate non-stick pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up or over-easy, according to your preference.\n",
      "7. To assemble the bibimbap, divide the cooked rice among four bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables, beef, and fried eggs on top of the rice in separate sections.\n",
      "8. Place a tablespoon of gochujang in the center of each bowl.\n",
      "9. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top and serve with kimchi on the side if desired.\n",
