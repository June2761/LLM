All materials, including refractories, can experience erosion or erosion-corrosion. Degree of\\nsusceptibility depends on the combination of critical factors to which the material is exposed.\\nB. All material which experiences corrosion from the process stream that also contains flowing solid media is subject to erosion. Examples of this are catalyst erosion in fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) and continuous catalytic reforming (CCR) units.\\nC. High velocities and turbulent flow cause erosion-corrosion even without solid media in the process flow. Carbon steel, low-alloy steels, and Cu-Ni alloys are susceptible to this. Examples of this are naphthenic acid in crude units and ammonium bisulfide in hydroprocessing units.\\nCritical Factors\\nThe critical factors for erosion and erosion-corrosion are the solids content, velocity, corrosiveness of the process stream, and material composition.\\nFactor\\nDescription\\nA.\\nSolids content\\nThe solids content in the process fluid significantly impacts the degree of erosion and erosion-corrosion. Slurries (solids suspended in a liquid) with > 1% solids should be considered erosive.\\nCirculating solid catalyst systems are very erosive. The shape, hardness, and size of the catalyst affect erosion, but generally this is not something that is controlled. Larger particles are more damaging because of the higher kinetic energy.\\nB.\\nVelocity\\nThe corrosion resistance of many metals is dependent on the formation of protective films or scales. Increasing process stream velocities imparts higher energy on the metal surface (high wall shear stresses), which damages and removes the protective layers and exposes fresh metal to corrosion. High velocities and turbulent locations in the corrosive liquid flow promote erosion-corrosion.\\nGeneral velocity limit guidelines are determined for each type of material and service combination and are grouped according to corrosive streams (with and without solids) and catalyst streams. Exceeding these limits may result in unacceptable corrosion rates. \\uf02d Corrosive streams with no solids: Carbon steel components with stream velocity\\n< 15 fps (5 m/s), and corrosion-resistant alloy (CRA) components with stream velocity < 30 fps (9 m/s).\\n\\uf02d Corrosive streams with solids: All alloys with solids content < 1% and velocity < 7 fps\\n(2 m/s).\\n\\uf02d Noncorrosive streams with solids: All alloys with solids content < 1% and velocity\\n< 10 fps (3 m/s).', metadata={'source': '/Users/jun/FullStack_GPT/files/IS20_Erosion_ErosionCorrosion v1.8.pdf'}),\n",
